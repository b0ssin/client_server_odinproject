# client_server_odinproject

This is a project for The Odin Project in Ruby. 
I didn't use external libraries like net/http or webbrick
because I wanted to reinforce the learning about HTTP
request/responses. I think learning how browsers parse through
them is interesting. Before I assumed it was a strange thing only
geniuses could do. This small, simple project really boosted my
confidence for learning.

Inside of the lib folder I have a text file that is just a mental
overview for myself, as I think writing about the project will help.
 You can ignore it.
